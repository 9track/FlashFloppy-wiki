FlashFloppy is a labour of love: working on it takes a **lot** of time
and effort. The development of new features, plus maintenance, bug
fixing, testing, release preparations and so on is a huge undertaking;
and that ignores non-development tasks such as writing documentation
and community management.

[![paypal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)][paypal]
to say thank you with a [**one-time contribution**][paypal]; or
encourage future development, refinement and community support with
a [**recurring monthly donation**][paypal] (be sure to tick the
box!).

No one should feel forced to donate -- FlashFloppy is and always will be
[Free Software](Redistribution) -- but if you would like to send me some
beer/coffee tokens and encourage ongoing development and support, they will
be gratefully received and give me a push to continue onwards and upwards!

Cheers!
