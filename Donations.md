FlashFloppy is a labour of love: working on it takes a **lot** of time
and effort.

[![paypal](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)][paypal]
to say thank you with a [**one-time contribution**][paypal]; or
encourage future development, refinement and community support with
a [**recurring monthly donation**][paypal].

No one should feel forced to donate -- FlashFloppy is and always will
be [Free Software](Redistribution) and a pet project of mine -- but if
you would like to send me some beer/coffee tokens, they will fuel me in
the push onwards and upwards!

#### Cheers!
