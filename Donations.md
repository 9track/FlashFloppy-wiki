Although FlashFloppy is Free Software, some people have expressed a
wish to make a donation for using and distributing it. If this
includes you please feel free to make that donation to a charity of your
choice. Money sent directly to me is donated to
[Macmillan Cancer Support](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/donate)
in the UK.

A couple of redistributors have chosen to donate 1GBP/1EUR to charity
for each unit they sell. I appreciate this lovely gesture but as with
end-user donations it is entirely at their discretion. FlashFloppy
will always be Free.
