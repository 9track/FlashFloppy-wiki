# FlashFloppy

A retro floppy emulator for the ubiquitous Gotek hardware.
- Directly supports HFE, ADF, IMG and ST image formats.
- Supports usage with no configuration! Just dump images into the root
  of an empty USB stick.
- Compatible with the HxC ecosystem: Autoboot and Indexed
  modes supported, and HFE image files.

Binaries can be downloaded from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/keirf/FlashFloppy/releases).

## Redistribution

Most code is public domain; the rest is MIT/BSD (see the
[COPYING] file).

The source code, and all binary releases, are freely redistributable
in any form. Because FlashFloppy includes third-party code under
MIT/BSD license, you should include or link to the [COPYING]
file in any redistribution.

This means, for example, you are free to sell and profit from Gotek
devices programmed with a binary release of FlashFloppy. However **at
a minimum** you should incorporate or link to the [COPYING]
file on your selling page. For example:
- FlashFloppy is free software. For more information see the
  [license][COPYING].
